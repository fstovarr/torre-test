## Progress

1. Review available information to define the app ✓
   - A Postman collection was added with a initial exploration of the provided endpoints
2. Develop and design the initial proposal ✓

   - The application to be built will be a job platform centered in Head Hunters.
   - The backend will be developed following a Microservices Architecture.
   - There will be 3\* microservices and 1 API Gateway (Users, Offers and Transactions\*)
   - Users will be deployed in Ruby on Rails, Offers will be deployed in in Ruby on Rails or Django, Transactions\* in Ruby on Rails or Django, and the Api Gateway in Express.js.
   - The application will use Kushki API as Payment Gateway, so we will have support in some countries initially.
   - The front-end will be developed in Nuxt.js
   - All the services and front-end will be dockerized, and deployed in Google Cloud.

   PD: Using multiple languages for a single application isn't always the best option, but I will do in this way in order to show my abilities as programmer.

   \* The development of transactions microservice will be evaluated according to my progress.
